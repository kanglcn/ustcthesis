  abstract = {New satellite missions (e.g., the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 constellation), advances in data downlinking, and rapid product generation now provide us with the ability to access space-geodetic data within hours of their acquisition. To truly take advantage of this opportunity, we need to be able to interpret geodetic data in a prompt and robust manner. Here we present a Bayesian approach for the inversion of multiple geodetic data sets that allows a rapid characterization of posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of source model parameters. The inversion algorithm efficiently samples posterior PDFs through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with automatic step size selection. We apply our approach to synthetic geodetic data simulating deformation of magmatic origin and demonstrate its ability to retrieve known source parameters. We also apply the inversion algorithm to interferometric synthetic aperture radar data measuring co-seismic displacements for a thrust-faulting earthquake (2015 Mw 6.4 Pishan earthquake, China) and retrieve optimal source parameters and associated uncertainties. Given its robustness and rapidity in estimating deformation source parameters and uncertainties, our Bayesian framework is capable of taking advantage of real-time geodetic measurements. Thus, our approach can be applied to geodetic data to study magmatic, tectonic, and other geophysical processes, especially in rapid-response operational settings (e.g., volcano observatories). Our algorithm is fully implemented in a MATLAB®-based software package (Geodetic Bayesian Inversion Software) that we make freely available to the scientific community.},

  abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry is a technique that permits remote detection of deformation at the Earth's surface, and has been used extensively to measure displacements associated with earthquakes, volcanic activity and many other crustal deformation phenomena. Analysis of a time series of SAR images extends the area where interferometry can be successfully applied, and also allows detection of smaller displacements, through the reduction of error sources. Here, we review recent advances in time series SAR interferometry methods that further improve accuracy. This is particularly important when constraining displacements due to processes with low strain rates, such as interseismic deformation. We include examples of improved algorithms applied to image deformation associated with the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, slow slip on the Guerrero subduction zone in Mexico, and tectonic deformation in western Anatolia, Turkey.},

  abstract = {Two caprock and cover collapse sinkholes, Wink Sinks \#1 and \#2, in Winkler County, Texas, collapsed in 1980 and 2002, respectively. They are located in a region underlain by the Salado Formation on the eastern edge of the Delaware Basin. The sinkhole collapses were associated with intense hydrocarbon drilling and production activities in the Hendrick oilfield. Production records and prior investigations imply the sinkholes developed after salt dissolution due to freshwater intrusion, cavity formation, roof failure, and successive upward cavity migration. High-resolution (1 m) aerial photography shows the ensuing expansion of Wink Sink \#2 from 2002 through 2010 and relative stability of the ground surface after 2010. Very high-resolution (25 cm) staring spotlight mode TerraSAR-X reveals the spatiotemporal details of Wink sinkhole deformations. The vicinities around the two existing sinkholes (Wink Sinks \#1, \#2) deformed at a rate of 5 cm/yr in line-of-sight (LOS) direction from October 2015 to March 2016, and the deformation was possibly caused by the gradual deposit of the debris from overlying unconsolidated Alluvium and Santa Rosa sandstones infilling the cavity after the sinkhole collapse. Specifically, the largest deformation of 53 cm/yr in LOS direction was found 1 km east of Wink Sink \#2. Our study suggests that severe drought in 2011 widened and created fractures as well as ground fissures in the rocks overlying and underlying the salt formation due to the increased effective stress. Fractures, ground fissures, and the abandoned unplugged boreholes or improperly completed wells opened one or more vertical pathways of freshwater from groundwater flow and precipitation toward the salt bed, finally causing the rapid salt dissolution and the opening of new cavities. To explain the onset of a rapid subsidence near the Wink sinkholes, our study considers the combined effect of natural perturbation (i.e., drought, rock fractures, ground fissures, subsurface drainage, precipitation) and anthropogenic effects (i.e., improper well control). Our method to explore high-resolution imagery can be applied to characterize the sinkhole deformation and mitigate sinkhole-related geohazards.},

  abstract = {West Texas’ Permian Basin, where the Wink sinkholes are located, is underlain by evaporite rocks that have been exposed to the dissolution due to natural processes and/or anthropogenic activities. We used the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique to process 16 ALOS PALSAR images from 01/01/ 2007 to 02/27/2011 for inspecting ground stability. Our results clearly show that two major sinkholes (Wink Sinks 1, 2), formed in 1980 and 2002, are both still subsiding, but the maximum subsidence for the 4-year period (2007–2011) occurred over an area about 1 km northeast of Wink Sink 2. The peak subsidence rate reached \$40 cm/year during 2007–2010 and rose to \$50 cm/year after 2010 when the area was hit by a record drought. Continuous monitoring of the subsidence in the vicinity of the Wink sinkholes is required for preventing and mitigating catastrophic outcomes of long-term developing geohazards to the area’s oil production facilities, infrastructure, and human safety.},
