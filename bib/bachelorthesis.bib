	abstract = {West Texas’ Permian Basin, where the Wink sinkholes are located, is underlain by evaporite rocks that have been exposed to the dissolution due to natural processes and/or anthropogenic activities. We used the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique to process 16 ALOS PALSAR images from 01/01/ 2007 to 02/27/2011 for inspecting ground stability. Our results clearly show that two major sinkholes (Wink Sinks 1, 2), formed in 1980 and 2002, are both still subsiding, but the maximum subsidence for the 4-year period (2007–2011) occurred over an area about 1 km northeast of Wink Sink 2. The peak subsidence rate reached \$40 cm/year during 2007–2010 and rose to \$50 cm/year after 2010 when the area was hit by a record drought. Continuous monitoring of the subsidence in the vicinity of the Wink sinkholes is required for preventing and mitigating catastrophic outcomes of long-term developing geohazards to the area’s oil production facilities, infrastructure, and human safety.},

	abstract = {New satellite missions (e.g., the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 constellation), advances in data downlinking, and rapid product generation now provide us with the ability to access space-geodetic data within hours of their acquisition. To truly take advantage of this opportunity, we need to be able to interpret geodetic data in a prompt and robust manner. Here we present a Bayesian approach for the inversion of multiple geodetic data sets that allows a rapid characterization of posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of source model parameters. The inversion algorithm efﬁciently samples posterior PDFs through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with automatic step size selection. We apply our approach to synthetic geodetic data simulating deformation of magmatic origin and demonstrate its ability to retrieve known source parameters. We also apply the inversion algorithm to interferometric synthetic aperture radar data measuring co-seismic displacements for a thrust-faulting earthquake (2015 Mw 6.4 Pishan earthquake, China) and retrieve optimal source parameters and associated uncertainties. Given its robustness and rapidity in estimating deformation source parameters and uncertainties, our Bayesian framework is capable of taking advantage of real-time geodetic measurements. Thus, our approach can be applied to geodetic data to study magmatic, tectonic, and other geophysical processes, especially in rapid-response operational settings (e.g., volcano observatories). Our algorithm is fully implemented in a MATLAB®-based software package (Geodetic Bayesian Inversion Software) that we make freely available to the scientiﬁc community.},

Analysis of a time series of SAR images extends the area where interferometry can be successfully applied, and also allows detection of smaller displacements, through the reduction of error sources. Here, we review recent advances in time series SAR interferometry methods that further improve accuracy. This is particularly important when constraining displacements due to processes with low strain rates, such as interseismic deformation. We include examples of improved algorithms applied to image deformation associated with the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, slow slip on the Guerrero subduction zone in Mexico, and tectonic deformation in western Anatolia, Turkey.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic formulation of inverse problems leads to the deﬁnition of a probability distribution in the model space. This probability distribution combines a priori information with new information obtained by measuring some observable parameters (data). As, in the general case, the theory linking data with model parameters is nonlinear, the a posteriori probability in the model space may not be easy to describe (it may be multimodal, some moments may not be deﬁned, etc.). When analyzing an inverse problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model is usually not suﬃcient, as we normally also wish to have information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case we may have a large number of model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But it is possible to pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyze and display the models in such a way that information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. This can be accomplished by means of an eﬃcient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no explicit formula for the a priori distribution is available. The most well known importance sampling method, the Metropolis algorithm, can be generalized, and this gives a method that allows analysis of (possibly highly nonlinear) inverse problems with complex a priori information and data with an arbitrary noise distribution.},

	abstract = {We consider deformation due to sill-like magma intrusions using a model of a horizontal circular crack in a semi-inﬁnite elastic solid. We present exact expressions for vertical and horizontal displacements of the free surface of a half-space, and calculate surface displacements for a special case of a uniformly pressurized crack. We derive expressions for other observable geophysical parameters, such as the volume of a surface uplift/ subsidence, and the corresponding volume change due to ﬂuid injection/withdrawal at depth. We demonstrate that for essentially oblate (i.e. sill-like) source geometries the volume change at the source always equals the volume of the displaced material at the surface of a half-space. Our solutions compare favourably to a number of previously published approximate models. Surface deformation due to a ‘point’ crack (that is, a crack with a large depth-to-radius ratio) differs appreciably from that due to an isotropic point source (‘Mogi model’). Geodetic inversions that employ only one component of deformation (either vertical or horizontal) are unlikely to resolve the overall geometry of subsurface deformation sources even in a simplest case of axisymmetric deformation. Measurements of a complete vector displacement ﬁeld at the Earth’s surface may help to constrain the depth and morphology of active magma reservoirs. However, our results indicate that differences in surface displacements due to various axisymmetric sources may be subtle. In particular, the sill-like and pluton-like magma chambers may give rise to differences in the ratio of maximum horizontal displacements to maximum vertical displacements (a parameter that is most indicative of the source geometry) that are less than 30 per cent. Given measurement errors in geodetic data, such differences may be hard to distinguish.},

	abstract = {Two caprock and cover collapse sinkholes, Wink Sinks \#1 and \#2, in Winkler County, Texas, collapsed in 1980 and 2002, respectively. They are located in a region underlain by the Salado Formation on the eastern edge of the Delaware Basin. The sinkhole collapses were associated with intense hydrocarbon drilling and production activities in the Hendrick oilﬁeld. Production records and prior investigations imply the sinkholes developed after salt dissolution due to freshwater intrusion, cavity formation, roof failure, and successive upward cavity migration. High-resolution (1 m) aerial photography shows the ensuing expansion of Wink Sink \#2 from 2002 through 2010 and relative stability of the ground surface after 2010. Very high-resolution (25 cm) staring spotlight mode TerraSAR-X reveals the spatiotemporal details of Wink sinkhole deformations. The vicinities around the two existing sinkholes (Wink Sinks \#1, \#2) deformed at a rate of 5 cm/yr in line-of-sight (LOS) direction from October 2015 to March 2016, and the deformation was possibly caused by the gradual deposit of the debris from overlying unconsolidated Alluvium and Santa Rosa sandstones inﬁlling the cavity after the sinkhole collapse. Speciﬁcally, the largest deformation of 53 cm/yr in LOS direction was found 1 km east of Wink Sink \#2. Our study suggests that severe drought in 2011 widened and created fractures as well as ground ﬁssures in the rocks overlying and underlying the salt formation due to the increased eﬀective stress. Fractures, ground ﬁssures, and the abandoned unplugged boreholes or improperly completed wells opened one or more vertical pathways of freshwater from groundwater ﬂow and precipitation toward the salt bed, ﬁnally causing the rapid salt dissolution and the opening of new cavities. To explain the onset of a rapid subsidence near the Wink sinkholes, our study considers the combined eﬀect of natural perturbation (i.e., drought, rock fractures, ground ﬁssures, subsurface drainage, precipitation) and anthropogenic eﬀects (i.e., improper well control). Our method to explore high-resolution imagery can be applied to characterize the sinkhole deformation and mitigate sinkhole-related geohazards.},

Moreover, atmospheric disturbances can strongly compromise the accuracy of the results. In this paper, we present a complete procedure for the identification and exploitation of stable natural reflectors or permanent scatterers (PSs) starting from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images. When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed. Examples are then shown of small motion measurements, DEM refinement, and APS estimation and removal in the case of a sliding area in Ancona, Italy. ERS data have been used.},

These targets often correspond to point-wise, man-made objects widely available over a city, but less present in non-urban areas. To overcome the limits of PSInSAR, analysis of interferometric data-stacks should aim at extracting geophysical parameters not only from point-wise deterministic objects (i.e., PS), but also from distributed scatterers (DS). Rather than developing hybrid processing chains where two or more algorithms are applied to the same data-stack, and results are then combined, in this paper we introduce a new approach, SqueeSAR, to jointly process PS and DS, taking into account their different statistical behavior. As it will be shown, PS and DS can be jointly processed without the need for signiﬁcant changes to the traditional PSInSAR processing chain and without the need to unwrap hundreds of interferograms, provided that the coherence matrix associated with each DS is properly “squeezed” to provide a vector of optimum (wrapped) phase values. Results on real SAR data, acquired over an Alpine area, challenging for any InSAR analysis, conﬁrm the effectiveness of this new approach.},

With its global coverage and all-weather imaging capability, INSAR is an important technique for measuring ground-surface deformation of volcanoes over cloud-prone and rainy regions such as the Aleutian Islands, where only less than 5 percent of optical imagery is usable due to inclement weather conditions. The spatial distribution of surface deformation data, derived from INSAR images, enables the construction of detailed mechanical models to enhance the study of magmatic processes. This paper reviews the basics of INSAR for volcanic deformation mapping and the INSAR studies of ten Aleutian volcanoes associated with both eruptive and noneruptive activity. These studies demonstrate that all-weather INSAR imaging can improve our understanding of how the Aleutian volcanoes work and enhance our capability to predict future eruptions and associated hazards.},

	abstract = {Studies of interseismic strain accumulation are crucial to our understanding of continental deformation, the earthquake cycle and seismic hazard. By mapping small amounts of ground deformation over large spatial areas, InSAR has the potential to produce continental-scale maps of strain accumulation on active faults. However, most InSAR studies to date have focused on areas where the coherence is relatively good (e.g. California, Tibet and Turkey) and most analysis techniques (stacking, small baseline subset algorithm, permanent scatterers, etc.) only include information from pixels which are coherent throughout the time-span of the study. In some areas, such as Alaska, where the deformation rate is small and coherence very variable, it is necessary to include information from pixels which are coherent in some but not all interferograms. We use a three-stage iterative algorithm based on distributed scatterer interferometry. We validate our method using synthetic data created using realistic parameters from a test site on the Denali Fault, Alaska, and present a preliminary result of 10.5 ± 5.0 mm yr−1 for the slip rate on the Denali Fault based on a single track of radar data from ERS1/2.},

	abstract = {Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an effective tool to detect long-term seismotectonic motions by reducing the atmospheric artifacts, thereby providing more precise deformation signal. The commonly used approaches such as persistent scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) and small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithms need to resolve the phase ambiguities in interferogram stacks either by searching a predeﬁned solution space or by sparse phase unwrapping methods; however the efﬁciency and the success of phase unwrapping cannot be guaranteed. We present here an alternative approach – temporarily coherent point (TCP) InSAR (TCPInSAR) – to estimate the long term deformation rate without the need of phase unwrapping. The proposed approach has a series of innovations including TCP identiﬁcation, TCP network and TCP least squares estimator. We apply the proposed method to the Los Angeles Basin in southern California where structurally active faults are believed capable of generating damaging earthquakes. The analysis is based on 55 interferograms from 32 ERS-1/2 images acquired during Oct. 1995 and Dec. 2000. To evaluate the performance of TCPInSAR on a small set of observations, a test with half of interferometric pairs is also performed. The retrieved TCPInSAR measurements have been validated by a comparison with GPS observations from Southern California Integrated GPS Network. Our result presents a similar deformation pattern as shown in past InSAR studies but with a smaller average standard deviation (4.6 mm) compared with GPS observations, indicating that TCPInSAR is a promising alternative for efﬁciently mapping ground deformation even from a relatively smaller set of interferograms.},

More than 50 active landslides covering a total of about 40 km2 area are detected. Then the short baseline subsets (SBAS) InSAR method is applied to retrieve time-series deformation patterns of individual detected landslides. Downslope landslide motions observed from adjacent satellite tracks with slightly different radar look angles are used to verify InSAR results and measurement accuracy. Comparison of the landslide motion with the precipitation record suggests that the landslide deformation correlates with the rainfall rate, with a lag time of around 1–2 months between the precipitation peak and the maximum landslide displacement. The results will provide new insights into landslide mechanisms in the Paciﬁc Northwest, and facilitate development of early warning systems for landslides under abnormal rainfall conditions. Additionally, this method will allow identiﬁcation of active landslides in broad areas of the Paciﬁc Northwest in an efﬁcient and systematic manner, including remote and heavily vegetated areas difﬁcult to inventory by traditional methods.},

The availability of both spatial and temporal information in the processed data is used to identify and filter out atmospheric phase artifacts.
